# youtube-to-text (WIP)


This code is designed to perform several different functions related to YouTube videos. Firstly, it is able to fetch videos from YouTube and save them for later use. Once the videos have been saved, the code is then able to extract the audio from the videos and convert it into text. This is accomplished using a speech-to-text conversion algorithm.

Once the video audio has been converted to text, the code can then search for a specific keyword or set of keywords within the text. This is done using the OpenAI API, which allows for advanced natural language processing and keyword analysis.

Overall, this code is a powerful tool for anyone looking to extract useful information from YouTube videos. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data analysis to market research and more. By combining YouTube video fetching, speech-to-text conversion, and keyword analysis, this code provides a comprehensive solution for anyone looking to gain valuable insights from video content.
